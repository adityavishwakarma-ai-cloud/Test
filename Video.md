## âœ… Best Options for Hosting Large Videos (100MB+)

### 1. **YouTube (Recommended for Public/Portfolio)**

* Upload your video (set as *Public*, *Unlisted*, or *Private with share*).
* Embed in HTML using iframe:

  ```html
  <iframe width="560" height="315" 
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" 
          frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  ```
* Pros: Free, unlimited bandwidth, optimized streaming.
* Cons: Branding (YouTube player UI).

### 2. **Vimeo (Cleaner look, Professional use)**

* Upload to Vimeo.
* Get embed link.
* Cleaner player than YouTube.
* Free plan has some limitations.

---

### 3. **Cloudinary (Developer-Friendly CDN)**

* Free tier: 25,000 monthly transformations + 25GB bandwidth.
* Perfect for embedding videos directly.
* Example:

  ```html
  <video width="640" controls>
    <source src="https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/sample.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
  ```
* Pros: Fast CDN, supports optimization & transformations.
* Cons: Free tier limits, need to create account.

### 4. **Google Drive (Not Recommended)**

* As you saw, unreliable for `<video>`. Needs hacks.

---

ðŸ”‘ **My Recommendation**:

* If itâ€™s for a **portfolio / project showcase** â†’ Use **YouTube (Unlisted)** or **Vimeo**.
* If itâ€™s for a **developer project (React, portfolio site, demo app)** â†’ Use **Cloudinary** (acts like a free video CDN).
